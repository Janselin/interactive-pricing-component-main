## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Typescript



### What I learned
This is my first collaboration with another dev. In this proyect I learned a lot of new things, first of all I learned how to work on a project already built with a JS Framework. 
Also learned how to add css styles to the imput range+ imput checkbox, and kept practising on the responsive design.
This was definitely the most challenging proyect i've ever worked on.


### Continued development

I'm currently studying JS so I will focus on that and start working on my own JS challenges.
I will also keep practising on the Media Queries.
